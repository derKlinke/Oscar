# ðŸ¦­ oscar

Oscar is a SwiftUI-based Mac app for monitoring incoming OSC data. It is able to listen to multiple ports simultaneously
and sort the incoming messages into channels. Floating-point data will also be visually displayed in a chart.

## Installation

You can download it [here](https://klinke-studio-public.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/apps/oscar/oscar-1.0.dmg). Updates
will be handled automatically from within the app.
Alternatively, you can build the app yourself by cloning the repository and opening the project in Xcode.

## Planned Features

- [ ] custom display methods for more than floating point data
- [ ] sending of osc dummy data with sine oscillators
